Image Synthesis using Diffusion Probabilistic Models: CIFAR10 FID=3.17, LSUN Samples Comparable to GANs, and Swiss Roll Data Analysis

Developed and implemented a novel image synthesis model utilizing Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to generate high-quality images, achieving a CIFAR10 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.17 without conditions. Demonstrated proficiency in connecting denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, while providing comprehensive analysis including log likelihoods and rate-distortion curves. Additionally, applied DDPM to generate LSUN samples comparable to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Successfully compressed data with controllable lossiness, enabling reconstructions and interpolations at various granularities. Further validated the model by testing it on 2-dimensional Swiss roll data and reproducing results as showcased in Fig.3 of the project's blog introduction
